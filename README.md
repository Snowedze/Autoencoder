# Autoencoder
I'm new on all of this.

I've based on this code:
https://jmetzen.github.io/2015-11-27/vae.html

He used MNIST, but i'm tryng with my own data

my data are not images, but arrays, so it can "be" a image if we reshape it.

I added a layer of hidden units, trying to do a Stacked autoencoder.

Now I don't know how to extract (or plot) the hidden units. (softmax)

If someone could help.. :)

Ps: I don't know if just adding a layer, it becomes a Stacked AE..
